# Welcome to Acorn Technology Python lab

This repo will contain some Python exercises meant to get everyone sufficiently comfortable with Python to enable its use throughout company projects and events.

## Prerequisites

To be able to do the exercises you need a computer with the following things installed.

* Text editor, preferable one that supports linting and syntax highlighting for Python
  * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (pick this if you don't care since others are using it and support will be easier)
  * Pydev
  * Pycharm
  * Sublime Text
  * Emacs
  * Vim
  * ...
* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

You will also need a Github account. Ask for access to this repo to be able to upload your solution for each lab to help others learn (especially the poor people that couldn't attend the live event).

## Workflow

Each lab will be located in a different folder. That folder will contain a README with the instructions and possible some starter/helper code.

After pulling the latest version of the repo, create a folder with your name as a subfolder to the current lab. This folder will contain all your work and should be uploaded once you've got it working (i.e. not when your done, since that will never happen...).

### Branching

During these labs we will live in the complete caos that is single branch development. Everyone works and pushes to main. This is because we don't care about history and we do not want all the solutions scattered over several branches but browsable directly from main.
